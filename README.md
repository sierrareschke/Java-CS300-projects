## Projects
- [Project 1](https://github.com/sierrareschke/Java-CS300-p01/): Initial iteration focused on developing code in a test-driven manner and implementing object-oriented principles (i.e. inheritance, single-responsibility, encapsulation). Outlies the foundation for all future iterations to build upon.
